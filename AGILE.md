# AGILE

This is where I will document my agile approach. It will be set into phases to help me organise my work. After a few false starts where i found myself getting lost, this will help me document my thoughts. Because of the fault starts my README.md has already been created. 

## Phase 1

- Setup repo
- Create Django project
- Install basic dependencies and add to requirements
- Create procfile to deploy to Heroku
- Create app on Heroku
- Link GitHub repo to Heroku app
- Test to deploy working project ASAP
- Document project creation and deployment
- Perform design thinking exercise for features to include in project
- Add user stories to readme
- Add wireframes to readme
- Mock up initial database design and document in readme
- List and link technologies used in readme
- Learn to use GitHub projects. Create user stories

Still to do:
- Identify a colour schema to use in the site

## Phase 2

Focus for the next session is to do with setting up templates to have a view of the home page. As well as this I will create my user stories in github projects for Phase 1, phase 2 and my overall User Stories to outline the project. 

- Setup base.html
- create separate components for site such as head, header, navbar, footer in a subfolder to inject into base.html
- Setup index page in home app
- Build navigation
